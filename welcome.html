    Carpooling, also known as ride-sharing, is a transportation model where individuals share a vehicle for their commute or travel. In carpooling, a driver
with a private vehicle picks up passengers who are heading in the same direction
or to the same destination and shares the ride with them. Carpooling can be
organized through various means, such as social media, websites, mobile apps,
or even bulletin boards.The main goal of carpooling is to reduce the number of
single-occupancy vehicles on the road, which helps to reduce traffic congestion,
decrease carbon emissions, and save fuel costs. Carpooling can also provide a
more social and cost-effective mode of transportation for individuals who may
not have access to public transportation or prefer not to drive alone
